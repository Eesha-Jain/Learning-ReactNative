# ToDo App Using React Native

I'm learning React Native by creating a basic ToDo App!

## Some info about React Native
React Native is a language fairly similar to React, a language used in web development. This makes it efficient to create websites because you don't have to learn an entirely new language!

Some alternates to React Native include...
* Android: Kotlin or Java in Android Studio
* IOS: Swift and SwiftUI in XCode

React Native allows you to code for both Android and IOS together while still making modifications to either Android or IOS specifically!

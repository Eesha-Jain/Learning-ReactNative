# Learning React Native (with ToDo App and extra files)

I'm learning React Native by creating a basic ToDo App and also adding extra learning files!

If you want to self-learn by viewing my code, go into the src folder and behold my code! By default, the app renders App.js, but I automatically set App.js to run files in the src folder.

## Some info about React Native
React Native is a language fairly similar to React, a language used in web development. This makes it efficient to create websites because you don't have to learn an entirely new language!

Some alternates to React Native include...
* Android: Kotlin or Java in Android Studio
* IOS: Swift and SwiftUI in XCode

React Native allows you to code for both Android and IOS together while still making modifications to either Android or IOS specifically!

## Skills I have integrated
* Basic react: functions, states, etc.
* Import other files
* Styling
* HTTP Requests
